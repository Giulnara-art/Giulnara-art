- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Giulnara, i'm 40Ð± i am yoga instructor and artist
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, contemporary-art, nutriciology, yoga and neurobiology...
I want to become a frontender because i need a good stable job, that i can do from home and also a want to train my brain rathe intasivly to be sure im not getting down in self-development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at Strada cours (frontend)
  There were lots of tryin to get my dream job, but i was quit because of different things: it was not anougt time to reach a good level of competence, my mom's role and even death of my computer, but i 'm here fore one more try. Dont wont to give up!
- I might quit this time again, and if it will be, i think the reason could be like i dont get the topic or cant remember everything i need, hope i'll be lucky this time
- Well. If it happened, i 'll be solid as a rock, i'll keep trying!
- I've got qualities to make sure that my path will be complited to the end, they are:stubbornness, positive looking, knowing some of mind tricks, desire for knowledge
- Iwant to be a part of a big copmany, such as Vk, or sber, or apple, or nike )
-I will work with a part of a copmany site, fixing problems, creating new features, working in a team
- I want to earn goood good amount of money (i know it will be not right away, when im finish the course, but at some patr of the way
- My first pay will go to cover all bills  and to buy a good modern lop top (because i havent it))
- i dont have a clear vision of my post study learning and things. Hope  Iâ€™ll go to interviews and understand what needs to be improvedÑŽ
And one more thing- the second subject -its english. Want to have a fluent level, that could be enough to comunicate with foreing team, for example
- Oh , God. I dont know about future, I dont want to dream alot. Just to have good quality of life. Do what i want to do. To live freely and peacefuly.
